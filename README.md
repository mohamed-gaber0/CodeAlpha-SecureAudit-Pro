## 📌 Overview

SecureAudit Pro scans source code for security vulnerabilities across **6 programming languages**, maps every finding to **OWASP Top 10** and **CWE**, and generates a professional, exportable audit report — entirely **client-side**, with zero data ever leaving the browser.

> Built during my Cybersecurity Internship at **[CodeAlpha](https://www.codealpha.tech/)**.

## 🧪 Example: Auditing a Vulnerable App

`examples/student_portal.py` is a deliberately vulnerable Flask application — **12 intentional security flaws** — built specifically to validate detection accuracy. SecureAudit Pro identified every single one.

The full generated report is available at [`reports/security-audit-report.html`](reports/security-audit-report.html), including:
- Executive summary with an overall security score
- Proof-of-concept for each finding
- OWASP Top 10 coverage matrix
- A 3-phase prioritized remediation roadmap

> ⚠️ **Note:** All credentials, tokens, and secrets in `student_portal.py` are fake placeholders created purely for demonstration. They are not real and were never valid.

## 🎯 Vulnerability Coverage

| Category | CWE | Example |
|---|---|---|
| SQL Injection | CWE-89 | String-concatenated SQL queries |
| Remote Code Execution | CWE-95 | `eval()` / `exec()` on user input |
| Insecure Deserialization | CWE-502 | `pickle.loads()` on untrusted data |
| Hardcoded Credentials | CWE-798 | Secrets embedded in source code |
| Weak Cryptographic Hashing | CWE-327 | MD5 used for password storage |
| Insecure Randomness | CWE-330 | `random` used for session tokens |
| OS Command Injection | CWE-78 | Unsanitized input passed to shell commands |
| Insecure Deserialization (YAML) | CWE-502 | `yaml.load()` without a safe loader |
| Disabled Certificate Verification | CWE-295 | `verify=False` on outbound requests |
| Insecure Configuration | CWE-489 | Debug mode exposed on a public host |
